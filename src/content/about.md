Hello! I'm Sofia, a software engineer based in Porto, Portugal who enjoys building things that interact with people. Besides my passion for technology, I love to travel, music, tv shows, and movies! One of my life goals is to explore every unique location of planet earth.

In my free time, I like to practice yoga and hang out with both humans and animals. Recently, I've been trying to lead a more sustainable lifestyle.
